      "description": "MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type. Example: \"x must be less than max (\"+string(self.max)+\")\"",

      "description": "Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired\"}\n\nIf the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority < 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:\n  - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n  - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\n\t  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n\t  \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\nExamples:\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}\n\nEquality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:\n  - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and\n    non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.\n  - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values\n    are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with\n    non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.",
